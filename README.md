# DiscordBot
A simple `bot` created for Discord group chats.

## Design
This bot uses the [Discord Bot API](https://discordbots.org/api/docs) to send/receive messages. 
This bot also utilizes the [Cleverbot](https://www.cleverbot.com/) application to respond to certain text messages.
To be able to run the code: obtain the bot key, cleverbot user, and cleverbot key. Add commands by adding the decorator `@client.command` to an `async` method. A great tutorial avaialable [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yahh4tR0L0&list=PLW3GfRiBCHOiEkjvQj0uaUB1Q-RckYnj9).
